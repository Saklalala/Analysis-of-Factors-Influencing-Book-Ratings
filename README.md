# Analysis of Factors Influencing Book Ratings

## Project Overview
This project explores the factors that influence book ratings using data from the "Book-Crossing: User review ratings" dataset in the kaggle. We employ several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Decision Tree Classification, to predict and understand the relationships within the data.

## Research Question
What are the factors that influence book ratings?

## Datasets
The analysis is conducted using three main datasets:
- **BX-Books.csv**: Contains information about books.
- **BX-Ratings.csv**: User ratings of books.
- **BX-Users.csv**: User demographics.


## Methodology
Our approach involves the following steps:
1. **Data Pre-processing**: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and vectorization of textual data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing and evaluating models to understand the influence on book ratings.

## Results
Our analysis indicates that while certain demographic factors and book characteristics can influence ratings, the relationships are complex and require further investigation. Visualizations and model evaluations are provided within the scripts.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations
- Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models
